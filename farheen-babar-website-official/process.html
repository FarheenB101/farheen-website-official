	<h4>Planning</h4>	
		
			<ul>
		<li>"Farheen Website.html" was created to introduce this website to the viewer, and showcase a little insight on every other page, and stated what each page was going to uncover. </li>
		<li>"Resume" was created to uncover my academic and work accomplishments and experience, particularly what I have accomplished in my academic career. It includes a profile, where I breakdown, giving an overview of myself, Work experience, skills I have garnered and am proud to do so, as well as one of my many participatory engagements at my school in the form of a poster. </li>
		<li>"Gallery" introduces Farheen beyond my academic experiences, delving deep into my character and how my I aim to better myself in each hobby and make the most out of my professional account. It includes two drawings as well as a book recommendation. I also showcase some more clubs I am involved in, for instance my DEMA program club, as well as the yearly UTM Mock trial. Finally, I show everyone my cat, with three photos as well as video. Each picture is provided with an 'i-frame' link as well as a hyperlink for the viewer's ease and percievability (WCAG2.0) to ensure the veiwer has multiple options of access. These pictures and video are all original and my own.</li>
		<li> The Contact page introduces an opportunity for the viewer to access my other pages online, including my Linkedin page (professional link), my instagram as well as where I go to school. I also gave the viewer an opportunity to connect with me through an interactive form. Finally, I implemented an imbedded  interactive map to showcase where I go to school. </li>
		<li>Finally, the process page is How I showcased every part of my design process! Attached is a document further explaining everything.</li>

	<h4>Design thinking</h4>
<p>I focused on cultivating a sitemap in my planning section. To define the site's purpose (which was to develop a professional site for myself) I kept in mind the WCAG2.0's accessability guidelines in creating a structure.
  The first thing I did was create a detailed design of what the rubric asked for - a five page website showcasing, me, as an accomplished candidate. I designed the website with five main pages available on the global navigation. "Farheen Website.html", "Resume.html", "Gallery.html", "Contact.html" and "Process.html". Each of these pages would give you an insight on all of my accomplishments and interests as a person.</p>
